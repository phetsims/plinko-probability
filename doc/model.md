# Plinko Probability - model description

The simulation describes the motion of a ball falling through a plinko board made out of pegs.

In the intro tab, a ball has an equal probability of going to the left or right of the peg. The ball goes to the left or
right. The user can choose to send 1, 10 or all the balls though the plinko board (up to a maximum of hundred) and watch
how the balls fall into the different containers at the bottom of the board.

In the lab tab, the number of rows and the binary probability can be modified by the user. The statistics are updated
after a ball makes it to the last row. The accordion box displays statistics related to the sample distribution and the
theoretical distribution. The theoretical average is P*N where P is the binary probability and N is the number of rows.
The standard deviation is given by the square root of N P  (1 - P):
The sample average is defined in the usual way and the standard deviation is the unbiased sample standard deviation. The
standard deviation of the mean is equal to the standard Deviation / sqrt( N ).
