The simulation describes the motion of a ball falling through a plinko board made out of pegs.

In the intro tab, a ball has an equal probability of going to the left or right
of the peg. The ball goes to the left or right.
The user can choose to send 1, 10 or all the balls though the plinko board (up to a
 maximum of hundred) and watch how the balls fall into the different containers
 at the bottom of the board.

In the lab tab, the number of rows and the binary probability can be modified
 by the user.  The statistics are updated after a ball makes it to the last row.
The accordion box displays statistics related to the sample distribution and
the theoretical distribution. The theoretical average is P*N where P is the binary probability
and N is the number of rows. The standard deviation is given by the square root of N  P  (1 - P):
 The sample average is defined in the usual way and the standard deviation is the
unbiased sample standard deviation. The standard deviation of the mean
 is equal to the standard Deviation / sqrt( N ).
